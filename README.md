**Product spec**

1. Context
2. Implementation
Product spec should allow teams to make decisions.

Product spec sets the direction of a product or feature. It is NOT too prescriptive.

Writing product spec at just the right level of detail -- neither too high-level nor too prescriptive is important.

Product spec also works as a tool to align all the teams.

**Product strategy**

1. Product strategy comes before product specs.
**Product vision**



What feature should be built?

Why this feature should be built?

How this feature should be built?



**Product Spec**

1. Context
    1. Why are you building this feature?

    2. Who is it for?

    3. Principles to follow

    4. How will you measure success?
2. Implementation
    1. What are you building

    2. Key functional requirements


# Context
## Opportunity
Here you'll talk about the user problem or the problem statement.

You should also answer the question "Why now" or why the time is right to prioritize this feature.

## Target Audience
Who are you building the product or feature for? Try to be specific about your target audience.

## Customer Insights
What was the most important insight from user research.

You want to identify key themes from user research and pen it down in product spec, sometimes using verbatim customer quotes.

 A good customer insight has two qualities: 

1. Counterintuitive, or surprising in a way that meaningfully differs from your default assumption about what the customer thinks and feels. 
2. It helps inform a material change to the approach to building a feature or product.
## Competitive Insights
- How does your competitor implement this feature?
- What functionality is necessary to include when you build it?
- How can you differentiate your product/feature from your competitors?
How to do competitive research?

1. Use their products.
2. Marketing material.
3. Product reviews
## Success Metrics
These are the metrics that will define whether or not your new feature or product is successful.

# Implementation
## Scope
1. What key functionalities (functional requirements) you need to implement right now?
2. What functionalities you might need to implement in the future?
You need to define the breadth and depth of your product/feature.

## User Experience
What the UX should look and feel like.

## Implementation Details
// Don't know what to write here.

## Launch Plan
Rollout process and rough timeline for the product or feature's release.

## Investigative Metrics
How often is this feature being used?











You need to do right tangible things at the right time to build something intangible.
